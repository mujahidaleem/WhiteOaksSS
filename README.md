The White Oaks Secondary School App

--Purpose & Goal--
The app's purpose was to shift focus away from the school's old announcement system and to provide convenience to both teachers and users.  Students and teachers had an inefficient announcement system that was often unclear and disorganized. The old system consisted of the announcements being played on the PA system, and then be posted on the wall of the office later during the day. This often led to the announcements not reaching students, due to the announcements only being broadcasted at very specific times in the day, and only accessible at school. I created this to allow students/teachers to access announcements outside of school, reducing the clarity issues present in the old system. Seeing a need for a more effective way to access school information, I decided to investigate possible solutions - hence this app. 

--Details about the Application--
- Written using React Native
- Planned to be used additonally with firebase for the backend of the announcemnts
